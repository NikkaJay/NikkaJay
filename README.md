- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikkaJay
- 👀 I’m interested in art, music, writing, books, theatre, etc. of anything creative and artistic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and css codes for Spacehey.com - it's the equivalent for MySpace, for those who remember.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can try to contribute in to the best of my abilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://spacehey.com/nikkajay I would try to advertise my Discord, but I'm protective of it for now.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/He
- ⚡ Fun fact: I type faster with the Caps Lock button and I don't need all my fingers resting on the keyboard to type. It's how I learned to type fast with less mistakes and how I roll. Deal with it.
